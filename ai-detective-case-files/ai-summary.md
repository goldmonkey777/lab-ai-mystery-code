### Case 1: Infinite Loop

:brain: Prompt used: “Why is this loop never ending?”
:robot: AI suggested: Add `i++` in the loop.
:bulb: My Insight: The loop never advanced the index, so it was stuck on the first element. I rewrote it as a for loop for clarity.
:white_check_mark: Fix: Used a for loop and explained each step with comments.

### Case 2: The Cryptic Function

:brain: Prompt used: “Explain this function step-by-step and suggest better variable names.”
:robot: AI suggested: It checks if a string is a palindrome. Rename to `isPalindrome` and use descriptive variable names.
:bulb: My Insight: The function was correct but unreadable. I clarified the logic and added comments.
:white_check_mark: Fix: Renamed function and variables, added comments.

### Case 3: The Over-Engineered Mess

:brain: Prompt used: “Simplify this function in plain JavaScript. What’s the intent?”
:robot: AI suggested: The function just returns `a + b`.
:bulb: My Insight: The original loop was unnecessary. I replaced it with a one-liner.
:white_check_mark: Fix: Refactored to a single return statement with comments.
